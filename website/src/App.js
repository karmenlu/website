          <SectionBody>
            Curriculum Associates is an education technology company. I was placed onto a team which focused on educator experience. Over the course of six months, I refactored databases with liquibase, documented APIs with Spring REST Docs, logged user interactions with log4j, and developed meaningful connections with mentors and my fellow co-ops.

          <SectionBody>
            I contributed to a project that was focused on the development of algorithms for activity detection from wearable sensors. Accelerometer datasets from different research groups were provided in a variety of formats. My task was to process these datasets and output a specific csv format which the mHealth algorithms used. Along the way, I learned about the Python pandas library.

            A tool for medicinal chemists to filter and group chemical compounds. By identifying compounds which are medically promising, this tool eliminates time spent on synthesizing chemical compounds which are not medically viable. Features that I added include a drop-down menu to select molecular fingerprint types and a color-picking tool.

            A video game which collects data that is used to assess how certain stimuli affect human avoidance responding. This project was built in collaboration with Dr. Nicole M. Davis, a professor of Northeastern Universityâ€™s Bouve College of Health Sciences. User interactions affect the timing and duration of four distinct playing states. My contributions to this project include the development of an admin configuration page and a user log-in page. I collaborated with my team at Sandbox and learned about JavaScript libraries like Lodash and styled-components.
