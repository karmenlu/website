        <div class="sectionBody">
            I am self-motivated and resilient. As an undergraduate student, I have leveraged opportunities 
            to collaborate with peers, to ask questions, and to learn from everyone around me. Since entering 
            college as a first generation student with no prior programming experience, I have been growing as
            an engineer through coursework, involvement in student organizations, and technical
            work experiences. In CS4550 (Web Development), I built my first non-trivial web applications, fetching
            from a weather API and working with tools like Vulture, namecheap, nginx, bootstrap, Elixir, 
            Phoenix, and React. I then applied and further developed what I had learned from CS4550 
            at Sandbox, Northeastern’s student-run software consultancy. At Sandbox, I joined forces with my peers to
            deliver impactful projects like Behavior Analysis and Cheminformatics. Soon after, these skills that I had 
            developed on campus came into play as I completed technical positions on frontend, backend, and infrastructure
            teams. Internships have served as a chance for me to learn more about the software industry and to work in large codebases.
            And now, I continue to learn. Committed to personal progress and curious about new technologies, I know that
            my journey is just beginning.
            <br/><br/>
            With graduation around the corner (May 2021), I am seeking full-time opportunities. While most of my past
            roles have centered around web development, I am an enthusiastic learner and would be open to any opportunities in
            software engineering/development. In particular, I am interested in the intersection of software and fitness/health/wellness.
            <br/><br/>
            Outside of work and school, my other interests include road cycling, running, inline skating, listening to music, and art.
